+-Sensors are added to actors
+-Director calls on them to perform sweep
+-NEXT:Where's the sensor data being stored? Director? Actor?
+-THEN:How to add sensor sweep as a foreground effect.
+-TEST:two actors.  Give one a sensor and fire it.  console out what happens. 
+-TEST2: draw the sensor trace.

Currently:
  results from test seem a little off so to say the least, so get inside the
  #evaluateCandidates method and starting adding tattlers.





-Actor Layers (also the idea of non-interaction BETWEEN layers to sim far distant..stuff)
-Force enacters (engines/thrusters/fins/wings/legs/etc.) ATTACHED to an actor.
-Universal Fields (universal attractor/repulsor)
     ie. Everything falls down, not just towards another thing, also
     to simulate wind, currents, etc.. environmental forces external to the actors.
-Sound.
-Local data storage (no libraries!)
