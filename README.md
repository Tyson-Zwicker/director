There are no dependecies, or libraries required to run this. It's just Javascript. 
It draws "actors" made of polygons, and you can add "child" polygons to the polygons.  You can make give
them a velocity and spin and they will move.  Add all your actors to the director and tell it to "animate"
and everything moves.  You can add a function to the main loop, which you can put your simulation/game into.

Eventually I will write a manual for this.
